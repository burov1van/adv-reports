              <strong>Click</strong> – a user’s action of clicking on an ad. It

            <div>
              <strong>Keywords</strong> – words carrying significant semantic
              meaning. They serve as triggers for showing ads when they appear
              in a user’s search query or on a site page.
            </div>

            <div>

            <div>
              <strong>Negative Keywords</strong> – words for which the ad will
              not be shown. They help narrow the target audience and improve the
              effectiveness of contextual advertising. Example: car -repair
              -service will show ads for “car sale,” “car rental,” and all
              queries containing that phrase except “car repair” and “car
